        wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Discovery
            + The Age of Discovery (or the Age of Exploration) is an informal and loosely defined term for the early modern period, 
                \b largely overlapping with the Age of Sail, approximately from the 15th century to the 17th century in European history, 
                \b in which seafaring Europeans explored regions across the globe.
            + The extensive overseas exploration, with the Portuguese and the Spanish at the forefront, 
                \b later joined by the Dutch, the English and the French, 
                \b emerged as a powerful factor in European culture, most notably the European encounter and colonization of the Americas. 
                \b It also marks an increased adoption of colonialism as a government policy in several European states. 
                \b As such, it is sometimes synonymous with the first wave of European colonization.
            + European exploration outside the Mediterranean started with the maritime expeditions of Portugal to the Canary Islands in 1336,
                \b and later with the Portuguese discoveries of the Atlantic archipelagos of Madeira and Azores, 
                \b the coast of West Africa in 1434 and the establishment of the sea route to India in 1498 by Vasco da Gama, 
                \b which is often considered a very remarkable voyage, 
                \b as it initiated the Portuguese maritime and trade presence in Kerala and the Indian Ocean.
            + A main event in the Age of Discovery took place when Spain (with the sponsor and crew of the Crown of Castile) 
                \b made the transatlantic voyages of Christopher Columbus to the Americas between 1492 and 1504, 
                \b which saw the colonization of the Americas, a related biological exchange, and the trans-Atlantic trade, 
                \b whose events, effects and consequences persisted to the present and are often cited as the beginning of the Early Modern Period. 
                \b Years later, the Spanish expedition of Magellan-Elcano expedition made the first circumnavigation of the globe between 1519 and 1522, 
                \b which was regarded as a major achievement in seamanship, and had a significant impact on the European understanding of the world. 
                \b These discoveries led to numerous naval expeditions across the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans, and 
                \b land expeditions in the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia that continued into the late 19th century, 
                \b followed by the exploration of the polar regions in the 20th century.
            + European overseas exploration led to the rise of global trade and the European colonial empires, 
                \b with the contact between the Old World (Europe, Asia, and Africa) and the New World (the Americas), as well as Australia, 
                \b producing the Columbian exchange, a wide transfer of plants, animals, food, human populations (including slaves), 
                \b communicable diseases and culture between the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. 
                \b The Age of Discovery and later European exploration allowed the mapping of the world, 
                \b resulting in a new worldview and distant civilizations coming into contact. 
                \b At the same time, new diseases were propagated, decimating populations not previously in contact with the Old World, 
                \b particularly concerning Native Americans. 
                \b The era saw the widespread enslavement, exploitation and military conquest of native populations 
                \b concurrent with the growing economic influence and spread of European culture and technology.

        wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_colonialism
            + The historical phenomenon of colonization is one that stretches around the globe and across time. 
                \b Ancient and medieval colonialism was practiced by the Phoenicians, the Greeks, the Turks, and the Arabs. 
                \b Colonialism in the modern sense began with the "Age of Discovery", led by Portuguese, 
                \b and then by the Spanish exploration of the Americas, the coasts of Africa, Southwest Asia which is also known as the Middle East, India, and East Asia. 
                \b The Portuguese and Spanish empires were the first global empires because they were the first to stretch across different continents, 
                \b covering vast territories around the globe. 
                \b Between 1580 and 1640, the two empires were both ruled by the Spanish monarchs in personal union. 
                \b During the late 16th and 17th centuries, England, France and the Dutch Republic also established their own overseas empires, 
                \b in direct competition with one another.                
            + Some commentators identify three waves of European colonialism.[1]
            + The three main countries in the first wave of European colonialism were Portugal, Spain and the early Ottoman Empire.
                \b The Portuguese started the long age of European colonisation with the conquest of Ceuta, Morocco in 1415, 
                \b and the conquest and discovery of other African territories and islands, 
                \b this would also start the movement known as the Age of Discoveries. 
                \b The Ottomans conquered South Eastern Europe, the Middle East and much of Northern and Eastern Africa between 1359 and 1653 - 
                \b with the latter territories subjected to colonial occupation, rather than traditional territorial conquest. 
                \b The Spanish and Portuguese launched the colonisation of the Americas, basing their territorial claims on the Treaty of Tordesillas of 1494. 
                \b This treaty demarcated the respective spheres of influence of Spain and Portugal.
            + The expansion achieved by Spain and Portugal caught the attention of Britain, France and the Netherlands.
                \b The entrance of these three powers into the Caribbean and North America perpetuated European colonialism in these regions.
            + The second wave of European colonialism commenced with Britain's involvement in Asia in support of the British East India Company; 
                \b other countries such as France, Portugal and the Netherlands also had involvement in European expansion in Asia.
                \b The third wave ("New Imperialism") consisted of the Scramble for Africa regulated by the terms of the Berlin Conference of 1884-1885. 
                \b The conference effectively divided Africa among the European powers. 
                \b Vast regions of Africa came under the sway of Britain, France, Germany, Portugal, Belgium, Italy and Spain.
            + Gilmartin argues that these three waves of colonialism were linked to capitalism. 
                \b The first wave of European expansion involved exploring the world to find new revenue and perpetuating European feudalism. 
                \b The second wave focused on developing the mercantile capitalism system and the manufacturing industry in Europe. 
                \b The last wave of European colonialism solidified all capitalistic endeavours by providing new markets and raw materials.
            + As a result of these waves of European colonial expansion, 
                \b only following thirteen present-day independent countries escaped formal colonization by European powers: 
                \b Afghanistan, Bhutan, China, Iran, Japan, Liberia, Mongolia, Nepal, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, 
                \b Thailand and Turkey as well as North Yemen, the former independent country which is now part of Yemen.

        wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_wars_of_religion
            + The European wars of religion were a series of wars waged in Europe during the 16th, 17th and early 18th centuries.
                \b Fought after the Protestant Reformation began in 1517, 
                \b the wars disrupted the religious and political order in the Catholic countries of Europe, or Christendom. 
                \b Other motives during the wars involved revolt, territorial ambitions and Great Power conflicts. 
                \b By the end of the Thirty Years' War (1618-1648), Catholic France had allied with the Protestant forces against the Catholic Habsburg monarchy.
                \b The wars were largely ended by the Peace of Westphalia (1648), 
                \b which established a new political order that is now known as Westphalian sovereignty.
            + The conflicts began with the minor Knights' Revolt (1522), followed by the larger German Peasants' War (1524â€“1525) in the Holy Roman Empire. 
                \b Warfare intensified after the Catholic Church began the Counter-Reformation in 1545 against the growth of Protestantism. 
                \b The conflicts culminated in the Thirty Years' War, which devastated Germany and killed one third of its population, 
                \b a mortality rate twice that of World War I.
                \b The Peace of Westphalia broadly resolved the conflicts by recognising three separate Christian traditions in the Holy Roman Empire: 
                \b Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Calvinism.
                \b Although many European leaders were sickened by the bloodshed by 1648, 
                \b smaller religious wars continued to be waged until the 1710s, 
                \b including the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (1639-1651) on the British Isles, 
                \b the Savoyard-Waldensian wars (1655-1690), 
                \b and the Toggenburg War (1712) in the Western Alps.

            + The Dutch Golden Age was a period in the history of the Netherlands, roughly spanning the era 
                \b from 1588 (the birth of the Dutch Republic) to 1672 (the Rampjaar, "Disaster Year"), 
                \b in which Dutch trade, science, and art and the Dutch military were among the most acclaimed in Europe. 
                \b The first section is characterized by the Eighty Years' War, which ended in 1648. 
                \b The Golden Age continued in peacetime during the Dutch Republic until the end of the century, 
                \b when costly conflicts, including the Franco-Dutch War and War of the Spanish Succession fuelled economic decline.
            + The transition by the Netherlands to becoming the foremost maritime and economic power in the world 
                \b has been called the "Dutch Miracle" by historian K. W. Swart.

            + The Thirty Years' War took place largely within the Holy Roman Empire from 1618 to 1648. 
                \b One of the most destructive wars in European history, 
                \b it caused an estimated 4.5 to 8 million deaths, 
                \b while some areas of Germany experienced population declines of over 50%.
                \b Related conflicts include the Eighty Years' War, War of the Mantuan Succession, the Franco-Spanish War, and Portuguese Restoration War.
            + Until the 20th century, it was seen as part of the German religious struggle initiated by the 16th century Reformation. 
                \b The 1555 Peace of Augsburg divided the Empire into Lutheran and Catholic states, 
                \b but over the next 50 years the expansion of Protestantism beyond these boundaries destabilised Imperial authority. 
                \b Although religion was a significant factor in starting the war, 
                \b scholars now generally agree its scope and extent was driven by the contest for European dominance 
                \b between Habsburgs in Austria and Spain, and the French House of Bourbon.
            + The war began in 1618 when Ferdinand II was deposed as King of Bohemia and replaced by Frederick V of the Palatinate. 
                \b Although the Bohemian Revolt was quickly suppressed, fighting expanded into the Palatinate, 
                \b whose strategic importance drew in the Dutch Republic and Spain, 
                \b then engaged in the Eighty Years War. 
                \b Since ambitious external rulers like Christian IV of Denmark and Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden also held territories within the Empire, 
                \b what began as an internal dynastic dispute was transformed into a far more destructive European conflict.
            + The first phase from 1618 until 1635 was primarily a civil war between German members of the Holy Roman Empire, 
                \b with external powers playing supportive roles. 
                \b After 1635, the Empire became one theatre in a wider struggle between 
                \b France, supported by Sweden, and Spain in alliance with Emperor Ferdinand III. 
                \b This concluded with the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, 
                \b whose provisions included greater autonomy within the Empire for states like Bavaria and Saxony, 
                \b as well as acceptance of Dutch independence by Spain. 
                \b By weakening the Habsburgs relative to France, 
                \b the conflict altered the European balance of power and set the stage for the wars of Louis XIV.

            + The English Civil War was a series of civil wars and political machinations between Parliamentarians ("Roundheads") and Royalists ("Cavaliers"), 
                \b mainly over the manner of England's governance and issues of religious freedom.
                \b It was part of the wider Wars of the Three Kingdoms. 
                \b The first (1642â€“1646) and second (1648â€“1649) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, 
                \b while the third (1649â€“1651) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. 
                \b The wars also involved the Scottish Covenanters and Irish Confederates. 
                \b The war ended with Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.
            + Unlike other civil wars in England, which were mainly fought over who should rule, 
                \b these conflicts were also concerned with how the three Kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland should be governed. 
                \b The outcome was threefold: 
                \b the trial of and execution of Charles I (1649); 
                \b the exile of his son, Charles II (1651); 
                \b and the replacement of English monarchy with the Commonwealth of England, 
                \b which from 1653 (as the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland) 
                \b unified the British Isles under the personal rule of Oliver Cromwell (1653â€“1658) 
                \b and briefly his son Richard (1658â€“1659). 
                \b In England, the monopoly of the Church of England on Christian worship was ended, 
                \b and in Ireland, the victors consolidated the established Protestant Ascendancy. 
                \b Constitutionally, the outcome of the wars established the precedent that an English monarch cannot govern without Parliament's consent, 
                \b though the idea of Parliamentary sovereignty was legally established only as part of the Glorious Revolution in 1688.

            + The Golden Age of Piracy is a common designation for the period between the 1650s and the 1730s, 
                \b when maritime piracy was a significant factor in the histories of 
                \b the Caribbean, the United Kingdom, the Indian Ocean, North America, and West Africa.
            + Histories of piracy often subdivide the Golden Age of Piracy into three periods:
                \b The buccaneering period (approximately 1650 to 1680), 
                \b characterized by Anglo-French seamen based in Jamaica and Tortuga attacking Spanish colonies, 
                \b and shipping in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific.
                \b The Pirate Round (1690s), associated with long-distance voyages from the Americas 
                \b to rob Muslim and East India Company targets in the Indian Ocean and Red Sea.
                \b The post-Spanish Succession period (1715 to 1726), 
                \b when Anglo-American sailors and privateers left unemployed by the end of the War of the Spanish Succession 
                \b turned en masse to piracy in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean, the North American eastern seaboard, and the West African coast.
            + Narrower definitions of the Golden Age sometimes exclude the first or second periods, 
                \b but most include at least some portion of the third. 
                \b The modern conception of pirates as depicted in popular culture is derived largely, 
                \b although not always accurately, from the Golden Age of Piracy.
            + Factors contributing to piracy during the Golden Age included the rise in quantities of valuable cargoes being shipped to Europe over vast ocean areas, 
                \b reduced European navies in certain regions, 
                \b the training and experience that many sailors had gained in European navies (particularly the British Royal Navy), 
                \b and corrupt and ineffective government in European overseas colonies. 
                \b Colonial powers at the time constantly fought with pirates and engaged in several notable battles and other related events.

            + The American Revolutionary War, secured a United States of America independent from Great Britain. 
                \b Fighting began on April 19, 1775, followed by the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776. 
                \b The American Patriots were supported by France and Spain, 
                \b conflict taking place in North America, the Caribbean, and Atlantic Ocean.
            + Established by royal charter in the 17th and 18th centuries, the American colonies were largely autonomous in domestic affairs and commercially prosperous, 
                \b trading with Britain and its Caribbean colonies, as well as other European powers via their Caribbean entrepÃ´ts. 
                \b After British victory in the Seven Years' War in 1763, 
                \b tensions arose over trade, colonial policy in the Northwest Territory and taxation measures, 
                \b including the Stamp Act and Townshend Acts. 
                \b Colonial opposition led to the 1770 Boston Massacre and 1773 Boston Tea Party, 
                \b with Parliament responding by imposing the so-called Intolerable Acts.
            + On September 5, 1774, the First Continental Congress drafted a Petition to the King and organized a boycott of British goods. 
                \b Despite attempts to achieve a peaceful solution, fighting began with the Battle of Lexington on April 19, 1775 
                \b and in June Congress authorized George Washington to create a Continental Army, 
                \b where John Adams nominated Washington as the commander-in-chief. 
                \b Although the "coercion policy" advocated by the North ministry was opposed by a faction within Parliament, 
                \b both sides increasingly viewed conflict as inevitable. 
                \b The Olive Branch Petition sent by Congress to George III in July 1775 was rejected and 
                \b in August Parliament declared the colonies to be in a state of rebellion.
            + Following the loss of Boston in March 1776, Sir William Howe, the new British commander-in-chief, 
                \b launched the New York and New Jersey campaign. 
                \b He captured New York City in November, before Washington won small but significant victories at Trenton and Princeton, 
                \b which restored Patriot confidence. 
                \b In summer 1777, Howe succeeded in taking Philadelphia, 
                \b but in October a separate force under John Burgoyne was forced to surrender at Saratoga. 
                \b This victory was crucial in convincing powers like France and Spain an independent United States was a viable entity. 
                \b The Continental Army then went into winter quarters in Valley Forge, 
                \b where General von Steuben drilled it into an organized fighting unit.
            + France provided the US informal economic and military support from the beginning of the rebellion, 
                \b and after Saratoga the two countries signed a commercial agreement and a Treaty of Alliance in February 1778. 
                \b In return for a guarantee of independence, Congress joined France in its global war with Britain and agreed to defend the French West Indies. 
                \b Spain also allied with France against Britain in the Treaty of Aranjuez (1779), 
                \b though it did not formally ally with the Americans. 
                \b Nevertheless, access to ports in Spanish Louisiana allowed the Patriots to import arms and supplies, 
                \b while the Spanish Gulf Coast campaign deprived the Royal Navy of key bases in the south.
            + This undermined the 1778 strategy devised by Howe's replacement, Sir Henry Clinton, 
                \b which took the war into the Southern United States. 
                \b Despite some initial success, by September 1781 Cornwallis was besieged by a Franco-American force in Yorktown. 
                \b After an attempt to resupply the garrison failed, Cornwallis surrendered in October, 
                \b and although the British wars with France and Spain continued for another two years, this ended fighting in North America. 
                \b In April 1782, the North ministry was replaced by a new British government which accepted American independence 
                \b and began negotiating the Treaty of Paris, ratified on September 3, 1783. 
                \b The war officially ended on September 3, 1783 when Britain accepted American independence in the Treaty of Paris, 
                \b while the Treaties of Versailles resolved separate conflicts with France and Spain.

            + The French Revolution was a period of radical political and societal change in France 
                \b that began with the Estates General of 1789 and ended with the formation of the French Consulate in November 1799.

                \b such as the 1917 Russian Revolution, 
                \b and inspired campaigns for the abolition of slavery and universal suffrage.
                \b The values and institutions it created dominate French politics to this day.
            + Its causes are generally agreed to be a combination of social, political and economic factors, 
                \b which the existing regime proved unable to manage. 
                \b In May 1789, widespread social distress led to the convocation of the Estates General, 
                \b which was converted into a National Assembly in June. 
                \b Continuing unrest culminated in the Storming of the Bastille on 14 July, 
                \b which led to a series of radical measures by the Assembly, 
                \b including the abolition of feudalism, the imposition of state control over the Catholic Church in France, and extension of the right to vote.
            + The next three years were dominated by the struggle for political control, 
                \b exacerbated by economic depression and Civil disorder. 
                \b Opposition from external powers like Austria, Britain, and Prussia resulted in the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in April 1792. 
                \b Disillusionment with Louis XVI led to the establishment of the French First Republic on 22 September 1792, 
                \b followed by his execution in January 1793. 
                \b In June, an uprising in Paris replaced the Girondins who dominated the National Assembly with 
                \b the Committee of Public Safety, headed by Maximilien Robespierre.
            + This sparked the Reign of Terror, an attempt to eradicate alleged "counter-revolutionaries"; 
                \b by the time it ended in July 1794, over 16,600 had been executed in Paris and the provinces. 
                \b As well as its external enemies, the Republic faced internal opposition from both Royalists and Jacobins and 
                \b in order to deal with these threats, the French Directory took power in November 1795. 
                \b Despite a series of military victories, many won by Napoleon Bonaparte, 
                \b political divisions and economic stagnation resulted in the Directory being replaced by the Consulate in November 1799. 
                \b This is generally seen as marking the end of the Revolutionary period.

            + The Napoleonic Wars (1803â€“1815) were a series of major global conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, 
                \b against a fluctuating array of European states formed into various coalitions. 
                \b It produced a period of French domination over most of continental Europe. 
                \b The wars stemmed from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the French Revolutionary Wars 
                \b consisting of the War of the First Coalition (1792-1797) and the War of the Second Coalition (1798â€“1802). 
                \b The Napoleonic wars are often described as five conflicts, 
                \b each termed after the coalition that fought Napoleon: 
                \b the Third Coalition (1803-1806), the Fourth (1806â€“07), the Fifth (1809), the Sixth (1813â€“14), and the Seventh (1815) 
                \b plus the Peninsular War (1807â€“1814) and the French invasion of Russia (1812).
            + Napoleon, upon ascending to First Consul of France in 1799, 
                \b had inherited a republic in chaos; 
                \b he subsequently created a state with stable finances, a strong bureaucracy, and a well-trained army. 
                \b In December 1805 Napoleon achieved what is considered his greatest victory, 
                \b defeating the allied Russo-Austrian army at Austerlitz. 
                \b At sea, the British severely defeated the joint Franco-Spanish navy in the Battle of Trafalgar on 21 October 1805. 
                \b This victory secured British control of the seas and prevented the invasion of Britain. 
                \b Concerned about increasing French power, 
                \b Prussia led the creation of the Fourth Coalition with Russia, Saxony, and Sweden, which resumed war in October 1806. 
                \b Napoleon quickly defeated the Prussians at Jena and the Russians at Friedland, bringing an uneasy peace to the continent. 
                \b The peace failed, though, as war broke out in 1809, with the badly prepared Fifth Coalition, led by Austria. 
                \b At first, the Austrians won a stunning victory at Aspern-Essling, but were quickly defeated at Wagram.
            + Hoping to isolate and weaken Britain economically through his Continental System, 
                \b Napoleon launched an invasion of Portugal, the only remaining British ally in continental Europe. 
                \b After occupying Lisbon in November 1807, and with the bulk of French troops present in Spain, 
                \b Napoleon seized the opportunity to turn against his former ally, 
                \b depose the reigning Spanish royal family and declare his brother King of Spain in 1808 as JosÃ© I. 
                \b The Spanish and Portuguese revolted with British support and expelled the French from Iberia in 1814 after six years of fighting.
            + Concurrently, Russia, unwilling to bear the economic consequences of reduced trade, 
                \b routinely violated the Continental System, prompting Napoleon to launch a massive invasion of Russia in 1812. 
                \b The resulting campaign ended in disaster for France and the near destruction of Napoleon's Grande ArmÃ©e.
            + Encouraged by the defeat, Austria, Prussia, Sweden, and Russia formed the Sixth Coalition and began a new campaign against France, 
                \b decisively defeating Napoleon at Leipzig in October 1813 after several inconclusive engagements. 
                \b The Allies then invaded France from the east, while the Peninsular War spilled over into southwestern France. 
                \b Coalition troops captured Paris at the end of March 1814 and forced Napoleon to abdicate in April. 
                \b He was exiled to the island of Elba, and the Bourbons were restored to power. 
                \b But Napoleon escaped in February 1815, and reassumed control of France for around one hundred days. 
                \b After forming the Seventh Coalition, the allies defeated him at Waterloo in June 1815 and 
                \b exiled him to the island of Saint Helena, where he died six years later.
            + The Congress of Vienna redrew the borders of Europe and brought a period of relative peace. 
                \b The wars had profound consequences on global history, 
                \b including the spread of nationalism and liberalism, 
                \b the rise of Britain as the world's foremost naval and economic power,

                \b the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, 
                \b and the introduction of radically new methods of conducting warfare, as well as civil law. 
                \b After the end of the Napoleonic Wars there was a period of relative peace in continental Europe,
