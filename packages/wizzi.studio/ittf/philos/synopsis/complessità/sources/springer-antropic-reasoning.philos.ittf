        + (Carter 1974; Barrow and Tipler 1996).

        + the universe appears to be fine-tuned for intelligent life and the emergence of observers – 
            \b if cosmological constants are not exactly as they are, 
            \b there would be no observers. 
        + The AP debate centers around two arguments: 
            \b (i) the universe is intentionally created for us as intelligent observers and 
            \b (ii) intelligent life is the result of improbable events that would not be replicated in other universes.
        + The first option is consistent with the existence of an external “creator”, 
            \b either God (an option that is discarded as unscientific), 
            \b or the possibility that life on Earth is seeded from other cosmic locations 
            \b as argued by the proponents of the directed panspermia hypothesis (Crick and Orgel, 1973). 
            
            The second option implies the existence of many universes (multiverse), 
            one (or only a few) of which (including our universe) contains life (Tegmark 2009). 
            However, there is another option that may be called the life principle (Davies 2003). 
            Given the abundance of the molecular material for life and the ubiquity of stable stars and habitable planets, 
            the emergence of life is a ‘cosmic imperative’ (de Duve 2011). 
            The life principle is consistent with the concepts of biocentrism (Lanza and Berman 2009), 
            biological determinism (Davies 2003; De Duve 2011) and some forms of the panspermia hypothesis, 
            such as the Hoyle-Wickramasinghe (H-W) thesis (e.g. 
            Hoyle and Wickramasinghe 1981) and transpermia (Davies 2003).

                + organisms from bacteria to animals are cognitive or semiotic agents
                + the human-type intelligence is only a fraction in the wide spectrum of natural intelligence 

            In this study I will use anthropic reasoning to arrive at the position, 
            broadly consistent with life principle, but also with biosemiotics, 
            that natural intelligence is a biological universal – 
            organisms from bacteria to animals are cognitive or semiotic agents – 
            and that the human-type intelligence is only a fraction in the wide spectrum of natural intelligence 
            which may be equivalent to semiotic scaffolding: “a tightly wound web of checks and balances gradually establishing 
            itself through myriads of semiotic interactions between organisms” (Hoffmeyer 2015, p 154).

    Here is a sketch of anthropic reasoning as derived from Bostrom (2002). 
    
    The process of sampling the world by which we, as observers, interact with the world 
    is limited by the inability of our observational faculties to capture the totality of information about the world. 
    The consequence of these relationships between observers and the world are observation selection effects 
    – we are necessarily handicapped as observers (Maor et al. 2008). 
    
    This handicap is frequently dubbed anthropic bias.
    The function of anthropic reasoning, on the other hand, 
    is to attempt to eliminate various forms of anthropic biases. 
    This can be achieved by pushing the borders of human understanding of the world to its limits, 
    by combining the cutting-edge scientific evidence 
    with the type of argumentation necessary to avoid pitfalls of the sampling bias.

    I start by giving a brief overview of AP and associated concepts from the perspective of biology. 
    I then focus on the concept of observation as understood by AP on one side, 
    and relational biology, evolutionary epistemology, biosemiotics and the systems view of life on the other. 
    This comparison uncovers fundamental differences between the two sides 
    and paves the way for applying anthropic reasoning further 
    through asking questions aimed at understanding the process of observation and true observers. 
    I conclude with the analysis of AP from the new angle which is not biased towards the neural-type intelligence.

    concept Anthropic Principle (AP)
        + was developed by astrophysicists and philosophers as an analogy to 
            \b the Copernican or mediocrity principle, 
            \b which states that humans are not expected to occupy a privileged position in the universe (Carter 1974) 
        + AP is consistent with the notion that the position of Homo sapiens is to some extent privileged:
            \b we are a species capable of 
            \b (i) cognition, which includes observation at the scale of the universe (observable universe) 
            \b and (ii) interpretation of our position in the universe
        + AP is thus an argument against the Copernican principle. 
        Given that biology is neutral about the position of individual species relative to the rest of nature, 
        AP is criticized by some biologists (e.g. Barash, 2018). 
        However, this does not mean that AP is without any value to biology. 
        
        Here is a sketch of AP adapted to biology.
        Our sensorium registers only a subset of signals/stimuli available in the external world, 
        leading to observation selection effects. 
        For example, we tend to view animals and people as independent individuals, 
        even though they are composed of numerous parts that once possessed individuality. 
        As a result, artists typically depict people as absolute individuals. 
        Lisa Gherardini, used by Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) as a model for the Mona Lisa, 
        exists in the mind of the artist, and the minds of the observers of Mona Lisa, 
        as an undisputed individual. 
        By contrast, a counterintuitive artistic vision of Giuseppe Arcimboldo (1527–1593) 
        depicts individuals as composites (Slijepcevic 2019b) (Fig. 1). 
        Unlike Mona Lisa, a rigid biological singleton, 
        Flora is a composite organism formed by the merger of formerly independent organisms (Fig. 1).

    
    From the perspective of modern biology, 
    Flora may be considered a more authentic portrait than the Mona Lisa. 
    Human bodies are complex ecological collectives consisting of 37 trillion human cells 
    (themselves collectives formed by the microbial mergers) 
    and 400 trillion microbes which together form symbiotic partnerships known as holobionts 
    (Margulis 1993; Zilber-Rosenberg and Rosenberg 2008). 
    
    Apart from the most basic microbes, bacteria and archaea, which are the only true biological singletons, 
    all other organisms - protists, fungi, plants, and animals - are archaeal-bacterial mergers and thus composites. 
    Absolute individuals do not exist above the level of single-cell prokaryotic microbes. 
    On this understanding, life is an organic conglomerate of transient composite forms. 
    By the same token, evolution is the process of the change of the composites.

    Observation selection effects in this case (Fig. 1), 
    represent the difference between the intuitive artistic vision of Leonardo da Vinci 
    formed based on insufficient evidence about the true structure of human bodies, 
    and the counter-intuitive artistic vision of Arcimboldo, which, though metaphoric, 
    is in some ways more accurate because the unusual artistic imagination 
    happens to be in line with modern scientific evidence.

    Thus, observation selection effects are the consequence of a specific epistemic position of the human observer 
    relative to the world.

    This type of reasoning stems from the AP concept (Carter 1974), 
    which implies that our position in the universe is privileged to some extent 
    “in so much as special conditions are necessary for our very existence” (Carter 1983). 
    Carter (1974) articulated two forms of AP, known as weak AP (WAP) and strong AP (SAP). 
    WAP states that our position in the universe is privileged 
    because our existence is dominated by our capacity to observe the surrounding world and the universe at large. 
    On the other hand, SAP includes an imperative that the universe 
    must allow the emergence of observers at some stage in its development. 
    Barrow and Tipler (1986) formulated their versions of WAP and SAP, 
    which deviate from Carter’s by allowing a greater degree of teleology.
    They also formulated a final AP (FAP),
    which states that an information processing capacity must emerge in the universe 
    and once it emerges it will never die out.
    Finally, Wheeler (1994) argued for Participatory Anthropic Principle (PAP) 
    according to which observers are necessary to bring the universe into existence.

    In spite of differences between various forms of AP, they share a common feature.
    All forms of AP assume that the minimum requirement for 
    the true observing capacity is the human-type intelligence (neural intelligence), 
    which eventually peaks in science and technology. 
    Thus, AP holds that the observers must possess, at the minimum, the human-type intelligence plus techno-science, 
    or techno-science-like method, as a form of knowledge acquisition. 
    If we accept this assumption, three types of observers are possible in the universe 
    (i) humanity bound to Earth (and on the verge of the cosmic adventure) 
        possessing techno-science at the present state of development as a form of knowledge acquisition, 
    (ii) humanity-like civilisations living somewhere else in the universe, 
    and (iii) civilisations with the observing capacities superior to the capacities of human or human-like civilisations, 
        living somewhere else in the universe. 
    From this, it also follows that AP assumes two distinct territories of life, 
    as we know it on the planet Earth: 
    (i) intelligent life represented by Homo sapiens and its technology in the form of techno-science and 
    (ii) all other forms of life (microorganisms, plants, and animals) 
        considered either non-intelligent or not intelligent enough from the perspective of observing capacities. 
    
    This position is apparent, for example, in Drake’s equation (Drake 1961) devised to estimate 
    the number of extraterrestrial civilisations in the Milky Way galaxy.

    N = R∗ fp ne fl fi fc L.

    where:

        N = the number of civilisations in our galaxy with which we can communicate.
        R* = average rate of star formation in our galaxy
        fp = fraction of stars with surrounding planets
        ne = number of planets that can support life
        fl = fraction of planets from the ne pool that develop life
        fi = fraction of planets with life that develop intelligent life
        fc = fraction of civilisations that develop technology for emitting signals in space
        L = the length of time during which signals are emitted

    Three components in the equation - fl, fi, and fc - deal with the distinction 
        between the life-developing and intelligence- or technology-developing potentialities of civilisations.

    However, I will argue that the key AP assumption is wrong. 
    I define the key AP assumption as follows:
    The human-type intelligence (neural intelligence) and humanity-type civilisation supported by techno-science, 
    is the minimal type intelligence/civilisation capable of the true observation at the cosmic scale.

    I will also argue that there are no fundamental differences between the observing capacities of, for example, 
    bacteria and Homo sapiens (Shapiro 2007; Ben-Jacob 2009; Lyon 2015, 2017). 
    Intelligence emerges not only in the case of interacting neural cells 
    but also in the case of interacting bacteria that turn their colonies into brain-like entities 
    (Ben-Jacob 2009; Slijepcevic 2018). 
    My argument is rooted in the notion that the process of life is inherently an observation-like process 
    whereby all organisms are cognitive or semiotic agents and 
    the process of evolution is a cognitive process (Maturana and Varela 1980),
    or semiotic scaffolding (Hoffmeyer 2015)
    This view is consistent with different versions of life principle including 
    biological determinism (Davies 2003), 
    biocentrism (Lanza and Berman 2009), 
    cosmic imperative (De Duve 2011) and 
    different forms of the panspermia hypothesis (Hoyle and Wickramasinghe 1981; Davies 2003). 
    In particular, the notion of organisms as cognitive agents 
    capable of sensing and processing environmental stimuli or biological information (Slijepcevic 2019a) 
    is consistent with the informational view of life implicit in the concept of biological determinism (Davies 2003), 
    or the concept of semiotic scaffolding (Hoffmeyer 2015).

Arguing against the Key AP Assumption
The motivation behind developing an argument against the key AP assumption is in line with anthropic reasoning 
- the purpose of anthropic reasoning is to reduce anthropic bias. 
For the sake of argument, let us assume that Fermi’s paradox maybe a source of anthropic bias. 
Fermi’s paradox may be stated as follows. 
The expectation is, in line with the astrophysical arguments based on the size and age of our galaxy, 
that humanity-type civilisations, with developed technologies for cosmic communication and travel, 
should exist and yet there is no contact with them in spite of SETI efforts (Jones 1985). 
We can argue further, based on the above assumption, along the following lines. 
Given that several decades have passed since the establishment of the SETI programme, 
at the heart of which is the AP assumption, and yet not a single piece of evidence was obtained to support SETI, 
an alternative hypothesis must be considered. 
The aim of the alternative hypothesis is to advance anthropic reasoning 
through reducing the anthropic bias by being more inclusive of the new evidence from biology.

To advance the case against the AP assumption I will proceed as follows. 
The AP assumption can be shortened into the following statement: 
There are no true observers in the universe below the human-type observers. 
The first task in developing the counter-argument is to define 
(i) the process of observation and 
(ii) the notion of true observers. 
To achieve this we can rely on Brandon Carter’s recognition that the term “cognition principle” (Carter 1983) 
may have been less problematic than the somewhat inappropriate term AP.

Therefore, substituting the word anthropic with the word cognition (AP becomes CP) 
provides a shortcut towards defining the concepts of observation and true observers. 
The process of observation may be interpreted as a cognitive process. 
It consists of three components: 
the knowing subject (humanity), 
the object to be known (the world or the universe) and 
the pool of knowledge used to justify our position in the world 
(technoscience at the present state of human development; mythologies, religions, and pre-science philosophy in the past) (Fleck 1981). 
From the perspective of AP, humanity self-selects evidence from the existing pool of knowledge, 
best suited to describe our position in the world/universe, 
in line with the prevailing collective opinion. 
The AP position is consistent with the view that the cognitive capacity, as described above, 
exist only in one species on Earth, Homo sapiens.

This leads us to consideration of the concept of true observers.
The SETI programme implies that true observers must be human-like observers: 
those observers that can 
(i) perceive local and cosmic-level information through natural sensorium and man-made technologies, or equivalents, 
(ii) reflect on the sensory inputs with the help of the accumulated explanatory apparatus (a techno-science like method), and 
(iii) direct its reaction on the cosmic scale through, for example, 
    emitting and detecting signals in space using appropriate technologies 
    with the hope of establishing contacts with similar non-local civilisations 
    that share temporal and spatial coordinates within the range of the signal (Ćirković and Vukotić 2013). 
Again, the AP position is clear. 
Only one species (or reference class of observers) on Earth has this capacity, Homo sapiens.

To start developing the counter-argument one can ask questions aimed at probing the applicability of the observation process and 
the concept of true observers on reference classes other than Homo sapiens. 

Here is the list of four such questions.
• Are human observers the only observers within the pool of terrestrial life forms? (Q1).
• If not, (a) what’s the frequency of non-human observers within the pool of terrestrial life forms 
    \b (some life forms, or all life forms); 
    \b and (b) if all life forms are observers, 
    \b what’s the boundary between the observing and non-observing capacities? (Q2).
• Are there true observers within the pool of terrestrial life forms 
    amongst the reference classes of observers that are not human? (Q3).
• Do human observers and other observers and true observers share common features? (Q4).

To formulate answers to Q1–4 I need to outline positions of the four disciplines of biology, 
relational biology, evolutionary epistemology, biosemiotics and the systems view of life, 
about how they interpret the process of cognition. 
A feature these four disciplines of biology share is the independence from the neural-type intelligence 
when it comes to interpreting cognition (see below). 
Only when the positions of these four disciplines of biology are stated, I can proceed with answering Q1–4.

            + This triadic concept is accepted by modern biosemiotics. 
            + However, the process of turning the concept of semiosis into 
                \b a fully-fledged scientific discipline of modern biosemiotics, included several steps (Barbieri 2009).

    The discovery of the genetic code pointed to the existence of 
    “[a] language much older than hieroglyphics, a language as old as life itself … its letters are invisible and 
    its words are buried in the cells of our bodies” (Beadle and Beadle 1966)
    
    As soon as it was discovered, the genetic code was interpreted as 
    a form of language used by the cell,
    which in turn becomes a semiotic system. 
    In this semiotic system, signs or symbols are required for various cellular functions. 
    Pattee (1968) articulated the idea that the cell is controlled by the symbols.
    By incorporating a range of ideas into semiosis including molecular biology, 
    the genetic code, and Von Neuman self-replicating automata, 
    Pattee argued that “life is matter controlled by symbols” (Pattee 2008).

    concept self-replicating automata
        author Von Neuman

    This paved the way for the emergence of zoosemiotics, the proposal that animal communication is based on signs (Sebeok 1972). 
    The reasoning behind zoosemiotics was based on the writings of Jakob von Uexküll. 
    This almost forgotten biologist provided a large body of evidence for 
        the existence of semiosis in the world of animals (Uexküll 2010). 
    Additionally, Thomas Seboek, with the help of collaborators including Prodi (1988) and Krampen (1981), 
    and relying on the evidence generated by other scientists (Sonea and Panisset 1983; Sonea 1987, 1988), 
    articulated the view that a primitive form of semiosis or protosemiosis exists 
    in the world of microorganisms and plants.
    
    All this enabled the birth of modern biosemiotics based on two key principles (Barbieri 2009). 
    First, “life and semiosis are coextensive”. 
    Biosemiotics is what makes animate matter different from the inanimate equivalent. 
    Second, the existence of signs, meaning, and codes separates biosemiotics from “intelligent design” and 
    doctrines, which assume that the origin of life has supernatural roots.

    The consequence of biosemiotics is the emergence of the

    school Relational Biology
The most prominent proponent of the school of relational biology, 
originally established by a physicist Nicolas Rashevsky, 
was his Ph.D. student, Robert Rosen (Louie and Kercel 2007; Louie 2010). 
        + To explain how science works, Rosen developed the concept of 
            \b a modelling relationship between the natural system (NS) and the formal system (FS) (Fig. 2 A).

        
        From the perspective of the human understanding of it, 
        the world is divided into the self (individual and collective humanity) 
        and its ambience (the rest of the world) (Rosen 1991). 
        
        The structure of the world is such that there is a congruence between the self and its ambience. 
        For example, the self (NS) internalizes the ambience through its model of it (FS), 
        based on language and mathematics. 
        The key thing in the modelling relationship is the concept of information which in Rosen’s diagram (Fig. 2 A) 
        is represented by arrows indicating encoding and decoding. 
        
        Rosen used the mathematical category theory to map the relationship between NS and FS. 
        In this form of mapping, encoding represents measurements or abstractions. 
        All measurements are generated through our senses or technological extensions of our senses (scientific instruments). 
        Thus, the abstraction becomes a form of internalization of the ambience by the self 
        through the scientific analysis of entities in the observable world. 
        Decoding, on the other hand, represents an “operator” that makes changes either in NS or FS 
        to test the modelling relationship. 
        Rosen’s category-theoretic mapping revealed that there is commutativity 
        between the properties of NS such as causality, 
        and the mathematical properties of FS including entailment (implications of the model, Fig. 2 A).

        At the heart of Rosen’s model is an attempt to explain the epistemological relationship 
        between any natural entity (NS) and knowledge of it (FS) (Fig. 2 A). 
        
        Rosen postulated that the entire nature models itself and 
        it is casually entailed in the form of a modelling relationship presented in Fig. 2 A. 
        In other words, science is humanity’s way of modelling nature.
        Similarly to humans, all other species use 
        species-specific epistemological methods to produce modelling relationships.

        To explain the universality of Rosen’s model Kineman (2007, 2011) and Kineman et al. (2007) 
        introduced biological structure and function into the model (Fig. 2 B). 
        The structure and function are the emergent properties of the modelling relationship 
        resulting from the original Rosen’s diagram (Fig. 2 B). 
        The structure is represented by natural measurements or abstractions 
        executed by the sensorium of each species. 
        The “operator” behind the process of decoding in the original diagram (Fig. 2 B), 
        when applied to the entire natural world, 
        becomes the process of the epistemological search for the biological function. 
        The entire process is tested by the filter of natural selection - 
        the filter tests various structure-function forms that emerge from the process of biological abstraction 
        leading to functions such as vision, flight, natural computation, etc. 
        Thus, the empirical world is emerging from the epistemological-ontological unity implicit in Rosen’s model. 
        
        The consequence is that all biological systems, from bacteria to ecosystems, 
        are anticipatory systems that contain internal predictive models of themselves and their environments (Rosen 1985).

                alias EEM
                + The key assumption behind was that animals are true learners or “knowers” (Plotkin 1982). 
                + The original position of EEM was recently revised to take account of the cognitive abilities 
                    \b of all forms of life including prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea), 
                    \b eukaryotic microorganisms (protists), fungi (single- and multi-cellular), 
                    \b plants and animals (Slijepcevic 2018, 2019a). 
                This more recent version of EEM reflects better the original principles formulated by Plotkin (1982): 
                (i) living systems are knowledge systems, 
                (ii) evolution is the process of gaining knowledge and 
                (iii) there are features shared by all forms of knowledge gain.

            In brief, all organisms, from bacteria to animals, acquire knowledge about their environments 
            through the process of natural learning based on a universal algorithm. 
            concept biological information
                The driving force behind the algorithm is the concept of biological information. 
                In the context of biology, information is a purely relational concept. 
                Any form of information becomes actualized only when there is a cognitive system capable of utilizing it. 
                Information, when non-utilized by a cognitive system, exists only as potential information (Ip) 
                (Jablonka 2002; Corning 2007). 
                For example, the presence of sugar molecules in a watery solution lacking cognitive systems such as bacteria 
                may be interpreted as a passive form of information or Ip (Slijepcevic 2019a). 
                Once the bacteria become part of the watery environment containing dissolved sugar, 
                they detect the sugar with its sensory apparatus. 
                The passive form of information, or Ip, once detected by the bacterial sensory apparatus, 
                becomes actualized and turns into control information (Ic) (Corning 2007; Slijepcevic 2019a). 
                This triggers the algorithm for natural learning.

            However, the automated algorithm process may not be consistent with 
                the notion of organisms as autonomous natural agents. 
            Thus, the term algorithm should be softened and viewed as a descriptor 
            for the sequence of events behind the cognitive process, 
            rather than an algorithm in the truly mathematical sense. 
            Most importantly, through the process of natural learning organisms create their environments.

            complexity theory (Mandelbrot 1983; Nicolis and Prigogine 1989) 
        greatly influenced some of the basic concepts in biology. 
        
        As a result, living systems are viewed as open thermodynamic systems,
        far from equilibrium, that constantly exchange matter, energy, and information with their surroundings. 
        The key feature of living systems is not their composition, 
        the nature of chemical constituents that make them up, or matter, 
        but rather the pattern in which the matter is organized to produce various organismal forms (Capra and Luisi 2014). 
        
        concept network pattern of organization

            Systems theorists and cyberneticists identified a common pattern of organization 
            that typifies all living systems – the network pattern. 
            The entire biosphere is a giant network consisting of intertwined 
            webs or networks nesting within the larger networks. 
            The key property of any network is non-linearity – 
            the pattern of organization within the network goes in all directions. 
            As a message, or information, travels along the network pattern it may take a cyclical path 
            leading to the establishment of a feedback loop. 
            Indeed, the organization of living systems from cells to societies is replete with feedback loops, 
            which eventually enable the living systems, including the biosphere at large, to self-regulate.

            This system’s thinking resulted in two important concepts in biology, 
            concept autopoiesis
            concept embodied cognition
            developed by Maturana and Varela (1980). 
            
            The key feature of the autopoiesis concept is self-organization or self-making (auto – self; poiesis – making). 
            According to Maturana and Varela every organism, from single-cell microbes to complex multicellular animals, 
            is an autopoietic unit – a system that sustains itself due to the network pattern of organization, 
            which allows constant self-regeneration within the boundary that separates the autopoietic unit from its environment. 
            However, autopoietic units are never truly separated from the environment. 
            
            concept structural coupling
            There is a structural coupling between the autopoietic unit and its environment.

            The nature of interactions between organisms and their environments is cognitive - the mind-like or brain-like 
            (Maturana and Varela 1980). 
            Any living organism, irrespective of whether that is a bacterium or an elephant, decides autonomously, 
            through its sensorium faced by various constraints, whether to notice a stimulus in the environment 
            and whether to react to it. 
            Noticing and reacting to the stimulus leads to structural changes within the organism and within its environment. 
            Through these structural changes organisms “bring forth a world”, 
            based on their own decisions which stimuli to notice and react to. As Capra and Luisi (2014) suggested: 
            “[C]ognition, then, is not a representation of an independently existing world but rather a continual 
            bringing forth a world through the process of living.”
